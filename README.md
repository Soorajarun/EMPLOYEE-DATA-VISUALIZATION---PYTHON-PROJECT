# EMPLOYEE-DATA-VISUALIZATION---PYTHON-PROJECT
This project analyzes employee data using Python: Examining Age Groups, Salary Expenditures, Positions, Team Distribution, and Correlations

Project Report Title of Project: Analysis and Visualization of Employee Data An Overview The primary aim of this project is to analyze a dataset that includes a variety of personnel information, including names, teams, positions, ages, heights, weights, colleges, and wages. To learn more about how employees are distributed across teams and positions, calculate compensation expenditures, and look into relationships between employee features, the dataset needed to go through a number of preparation and analytical procedures.

The report that follows describes the main actions taken, the conclusions drawn from the study, and the visual aids employed to successfully convey the findings. All calculations, data cleansing, and visualizations were done in Python using tools like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn.
Preprocessing: Objective: Fix the data and guarantee its integrity and consistency. Task: There were some missing or inaccurate values in the "Height" column. To fix this: To maintain consistency, I substituted random numbers between 150 and 180 for the values in the "Height" column. The mode values were used to fill in the missing values in the "College" and "Salary" columns. By taking this step, the dataset was guaranteed to be clean and prepared for analysis.
Analysis Tasks:
1. Employee Distribution Within Teams: Objective: Determine how many employees are on each team and what proportion of the total number of employees are on each team. Results: New Orleans Pelicans employees made up the largest percentage (4.14%), followed by Utah Jazz (3.4%) and Memphis Grizzlies (3.9%). To display the number of workers and the percentage distribution for every team, a data frame was made. Illustrations: The number of workers on each team was displayed in a bar chart. Pie Chart: Showed the proportion of workers in each team for easier comparison.
2. Employee Separation by Position: Goal: Divide workers into groups according to their roles inside the organization. Conclusions: The position with the most employees (102), SG (Shooting Guard), was followed by PF (Power Forward) with 100 and PG (Point Guard) with 92. Illustrations: The number of employees in each position was shown in a bar chart. Pie Chart: Provided a clear visual comparison by displaying the percentage distribution of workers by position.
3. Finding the Predominant Age Group: The goal is to determine which age group is most prevalent among the staff members. Findings: Of the employees, 72.9% belonged to the 20–30 age group, which was followed by the 31–40 age group. There was a noticeable concentration of younger workers in the age distribution. Illustrations: Donut Chart: Showed the percentage of workers in each age bracket. The dataset's age distribution was displayed using the histogram. With a minimum age of 20 and a maximum age of 90, the box plot showed the age distribution and highlighted outliers.
4. Highest Salary Expenditure by Position and Team: Objective: Find out which combination of team and position spent the most money on salaries. Results: The Miami Heat's PF (Power Forward) position and the Los Angeles Lakers' SF (Small Forward) position had the greatest salary expenditures. Illustrations: Dist Plot: Displayed how employee pay were distributed overall. A line plot made it simple to compare salary outflows by showing the salary spending for various teams and roles.
5. Relationship Between Age and Salary: Goal: Find out if there is a relationship at all between an employee's age and pay. Results: The correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between age and pay, indicating that employees' salaries typically rise in tandem with their ages. Illustrations: Joint Plot: Shown a scatter plot with the age and salary marginal distributions. Scatter Plot: Clearly showed how age and income relate to one another. A trend line from the regression plot further supported the idea that age and salary are positively correlated.
